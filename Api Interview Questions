1. What are the things that you validate when an api is given
a. Verify Json Schema validations
b. Verify Accuracy of data
c. HTTP status codes
d. Data type, validations, order(if important), and completeness
e. Response Time 
f. Authorization checks
g. Non-functional testing like performance and security testing
h. Error codes in case API returns

2. Status codes
200 - ok
201 - The resource is created, generally used for put or post call
4xx - client side
404 - Page/Resource Not Found
400 - Bad request
401 - Unauthorized error (Generally when you give invalid credentials/No tokens/No credentials)
400 - wrong body
403 - FORBIDDEN (Valid credentials but not able to access resources since server is not able to understand or sufficient)
500 - Server error

3. HTTP API Methods(CRUD)
get - Get the resource
put - can be used for creating or updating the resources(generally for update)
1. Server might have or not support for upsert(insert + update) using put
Here id can be sent as part of the request body
2. Server might have support only for update using put
Here id is sent as part of path param and request body part of body
All the data is completely updated
Errors of Put Request
404 - if id not found/wrong param
400 - wrong body
409 - Not possible in put
post - creating the new resource
delete - used to delete the resource

4. Difference between put and patch
Actual Body
{
"name": "Vinod",
"number": "4567",
"id": "45000000"
}

Put - send whole body to update a field for a resource/id
{
"name": "Vinod",
"number": "1234",
"id": "45000000"

}
Patch - send only what is needed to updated
{
"number": "1234"
}
